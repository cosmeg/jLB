no jlb:destguid
  I was getting a lot of these w/ nether tempest on shek'zeer
    it's possible this is due to refreshing
      (something that doesn't happen often with living bomb)
    it's also possible it's due to adds (?)
  try this
    NT, wait, refresh NT, let it fall off ==> works
    frost bomb - explodes before it expires
  double deleting?
  is there really a bar object w/ no destguid? how?
  bar recycling?
  XXX is the guid the same?
    i.e. 2 mobs
  is the guid ever being set?


TODO add sheep?
put in nameplates instead of bars?
TODO emphasize current target?
  listen to target-swap event
  get the guid
  style bars


actually, this mod might not be needed at all!

When you splash LB it *will not* refresh/overwrite another one.

So e.g. this is safe:
- LB target 1
- LB target 2
- IB target 2
    it won't reset target 1

Also
- LB t1
- IT to t2 t3
- t1 dies
- LB t4
- IT
    won't affect t2 or t3

it's still useful to see *how many* are active
  but how accurate is it?

TODO what about more than 3 targets?
