actually, this mod might not be needed at all!

When you splash LB it *will not* refresh/overwrite another one.

So e.g. this is safe:
- LB target 1
- LB target 2
- IB target 2
    it won't reset target 1

Also
- LB t1
- IT to t2 t3
- t1 dies
- LB t4
- IT
    won't affect t2 or t3

it's still useful to see *how many* are active
  but how accurate is it?

TODO what about more than 3 targets?
